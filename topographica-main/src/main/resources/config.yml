# 
# web-server:
#   Here the internal web server is configured.
#   port: 
#     The port at which the web server listens. If you have set the port to
#     8088, then the map should appear in your web browser at
#     http://<your-server-ip>:8088/ . If it does not, then that port is probably
#     blocked. Look for errors in your console, try a different port or contact
#     your hosting provider.
#   web-root:
#     The map images are placed in this directory. Normally, this directory
#     resides inside plugins/@PROJECT_NAME@/ , but you can set the web root to
#     any writeable directory.
# 
# worlds:
#   Here each world can be configured. The world named "default"
#   is used for all worlds that do not have their own settings.
#   The most important setting is the radius. The radius is set
#   in blocks, and controls how much of the world is rendered
#   around the center. A radius of 0 disables the map for that world.
