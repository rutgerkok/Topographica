# Configuration file of @PROJECT_NAME@ v@VERSION@ (@DATE@)
# 
# EXPLANATION OF THE SETTINGS
# ... scroll down for the actual settings ...
# 
# timings:
#   These settings are used to make the plugin use less server resources.
#   The higher the numbers, the more time the server has to do other things,
#   and the slower the map will update.
#   pause-seconds-after-render-pass: 60
#     After everything on the server is rendered, the plugin will wait this amount of time
#     before starting a new render pass.
#   pause-seconds-after-chunk-load: 0.5
#     After the plugin needed to load a chunk, it will pause this amount of seconds before
#     continuing rendering.
#   no-pause-after-chunk-load-when-nobody-is-online: true
#     Set this to true to disable the chunk loading pause when there is nobody online. This
#     speeds up rendering when the server is empty.
#   
# web-server:
#   Here the internal web server is configured.
#   port: 
#     The port at which the web server listens. If you have set the port to
#     8088, then the map should appear in your web browser at
#     http://<your-server-ip>:8088/ . If it does not, then that port is probably
#     blocked. Look for errors in your console, try a different port or contact
#     your hosting provider.
#   web-root:
#     The map images are placed in this directory. Normally, this directory
#     resides inside plugins/@PROJECT_NAME@/ , but you can set the web root to
#     any writeable directory.
# 
# worlds:
#   Here each world can be configured. The world named "default" is used for all
#   worlds that do not have their own settings. The most important setting is
#   the radius. The radius is set in blocks, and controls how much of the world
#   is rendered around the center. A radius of 0 disables the map for that world.
